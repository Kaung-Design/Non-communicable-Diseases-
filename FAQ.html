        <br>
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>Q: What are Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDS)?</h2>
            <p>A: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are chronic diseases that are not passed from person to person. They usually progress slowly and can last for long periods, often for a lifetime. 
                Common types include cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes.</p>
            <br><br><br>

            <h2>Q: What causes NCDs?</h2>
            <p>A: NCDs are often caused by a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental, and behavioral factors. 
                Key risk factors include unhealthy diets, lack of physical activity, tobacco use, and excessive alchohol consumption.</p>
            <br><br><br>

            <h2>Q: How can I reduce my risk of developing NCDs?</h2>
            <p>A: Lifestyle changes can significantly reduce the risk of NCDs. 
                Eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, avoiding tobacco, limiting alchohol, and managing stress can all help prevent these diseases.</p>
            <br><br><br>

            <h2>Q: Are NCDs treatable?</h2>
            <p>A: Yes, NCDs are treatable, and managing them effectively can improve quality of life.
                Treatments can include medication, lifestyle changes, and regular monitoring by healthcare professionals.
                Early diagnosis and intervention are critical.</p>
            <br><br><br>

            <h2>Q: Can children develop NCDs?</h2>
            <p>A: Yes, children can develop NCDs, although they are more common in adults. 
                Childhood obesity, poor diet, and lack of physical activity can increase the risk of children developing NCDs later in life.</p>
            <br><br><br>

            <h2>Q: What are the common symptoms of NCDs?</h2>
            <p>A: Symtoms vary by disease type:
                <ul>
                    <li>Heart disease: chest pain, shortness of breath, irregular heartbeat.</li>
                    <li>Cancer: unexplained weight loss, fatigue, lumps, or abnormal bleeding.</li>
                    <li>Diabetes: excessive thirst, frequent urination, fatigue.</li>
                    <li>Chronic respiratory diseases: coughing, wheezing, breathlessness</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br><br><br>

            <h2>Q: How do NCDs impact global health?</h2>
            <p>A: NCDs are a major public health concern worldwide, responsible for approximately 70% of global deaths annually.
                They place significant strain on healthcare systems and economies, particularl in low-and middle-income countries.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>

            <h2>Q: What role does diet play in NCD prevention?</h2>
            <p>A: Diet is a crucial factor in preventing NCDs. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help reduce risks, while excessive sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats should be limited</p>
            <br><br><br>

            <h2>Q: How often should I get screened for NCDs?</h2>
            <p>A: Screening frequency depends on factors such as age, family history, and lifestyle.
                Generally, adults should have regular screenings for blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, and cancer as recommanded by a healthcare provider.</p>
            <br><br><br>

            <h2>Q: Where can I find support if I or a loved one is diagnosed with an NCD?</h2>
            <p>A: There are many resources available, including support groups, healthcare providers, and online communities that provide information, emotional support, and guidance for managing NCDs.</p>
            <br><br><br>

            <h2>Q: Are there vaccines for NCDs?</h2>
            <p>A: While vaccines exist for certain infectoins that can increase the risk of NCDs (e.g., HPV for cancer prevention), there are currently no vaccines for NCDs themselves.
                Prevention focuses on lifestyle changes nad managing risk factors.
            </p>
